practice gpio sysfs
Excercise:
Write a GPIO sysfs driver.
The goal of this exercise is to handle GPIOs of the hardware through Sysfs interface
The driver should support the below functionality
        1)The driver should create a class "bone_gpios" under /sys/class (class_create)

        2)For every detected GPIO in the device tree, the driver should create a device under /sys/class/bone_gpios (device_create)
        
        3) the driver should also create 3 sysfs files(attributes ) for every gpio device
- attribute 1) direction:
used to configure the gpio direction 
possible values: ‘in’ and ‘out’
mode : (read /write)
- attribute 2) value: 
used to enquire the state of the gpio or to write a new value to the gpio
possible values : 0 and 1 (read/write)
attribute 3) label: 
used to enquire label of the gpio (read-only )
        4) implement show and store methods for the attributes
